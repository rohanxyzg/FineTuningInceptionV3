# FineTuningInceptionV3
In this project I fine-tuned InceptionV3 architecture for flowers classification task. prepared images for the model using the Flowers classification dataset (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) Implemented a batch generator that yields items in batches of same size. fine-tuned the pre-trained model using InceptionV3 architecture.
